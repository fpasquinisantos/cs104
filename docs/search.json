    "text": "Materials\n\nTextbook\n\nZyBooks — We will be using an online text called Programming in Python 3 with ZyLabs. The text will cost $77 and can be accessed as follows:\n\nSign up at learn.zybooks.com (see Zyante’s privacy policy). Note that you must use your Calvin e-mail address (e.g., xyz27@calvin.edu).\nEnter zyBook code: **CALVINCS104Fall2023**\nClick Subscribe.\n\n\nYou’ll also see that ZyBooks provides reading, lab and homework assignments matching those specified in the unit preparation pages on Moodle (find these under the “Assignments” tab on the far bottom right of our course textbook page). Though the ZyBooks text is interactive, you do have the option to print a PDF version of each chapter, which can be useful as a reference after the course is over and the ZyBooks electronic submission has ended.\n\nActivities for CS1 in Python, T. Shepherd, C. Mayfield & H. Hu, Creative Commons — These are available online or, optionally, in paper form from the book store. We will use those for the POGIL Activities usually on Fridays.\nSeveral articles on programming that will be availabe on Perusall. These will form our perspective readings and we expect you to interact and discuss on these texts.\n\n\n\nCommunication\nOutside of class, we’ll use:\n\nMoodle:\n\nAfter each class, you will be invited to answer a feedback form on Moodle, to inform about your progress in the course and what is still not clear to you. This won’t be graded, but will be a nice way to give me feedback and orient my next classes in a way that is good for you.\nBesides that, you can also use our Q&A Forum to post questions on assignments, concepts discussed in class, or when you have problems getting code to run. Post answers as well. You might be able to provide a good answer before the course staff even sees the question!\nWe also have a General Topics forum, in case you want to post notes on articles or events that might be of interest to the class. In general, don’t post code publicly. If you have to include code, make the post private first so the course staff can decide if it’s ok to share.\n\nEmail — Please restrict email use for requests for accommodations (e.g.: missing class; disabilities; mental health; etc.).\n\nYou’ll generally find us responsive on Monday through Friday, but less so on the weekend, particularly Sunday. You’re free to schedule your work as best works for you, but we’ll be trying to observe a Sabbath in our own schedules.\n\n\nWork Environment\nWe will use Thonny as the integrated development environment of our programming exercises in Python.\nThe labs in SB 354 & 372 are pre-configured to support this course, so if you are on campus, you are free to do all your course work there. If you are off campus, you have two options: a) using your own machine or b) accessing the lab machines remotely. We suggest that you install the software on your own machine and then use the option you find most convenient.\n\nInstall Thonny in your own machine Install the latest version of Thonny development environment for your system type. Thonny has a current version of Python built-in and should work without further configuration; or\nAccess the lab machines remotely There are a limited number of remote and virtual machines available for CS courses. You can find:\n\nthe list of machines here: https://remote.cs.calvin.edu\nthe instructions for using those machines here: https://cs.calvin.edu/sysadmin/remoteaccess-guacamole.php"

    "section": "Activities",
    "text": "Activities\nEvery week we will go through the following:\n\nPreparation reading (zyBooks textbook): you’ll do these readings as a preparation for introducing new unit on Fridays. As you work through the text, complete the “participation” activities in the specified sections as you go. You can skip the “challenge” activities.\nPerspectives reading (Perusall): you’ll read an article about common themes in programming and their wider societal implications. After this reading, you will be asked to make comments on the text and interact with your colleagues responses. Perusall has many nice tools to make this a nice shared reading experience. Try not to do it just for the sake of getting the assignment done and get the grade.\nPOGIL Activity: when introducing a new Unit on every Friday, we will proceed according to a POGIL approach (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning). We will form teams of three students in order to solve a set of questions and exercises. The teams will need to have:\n\na programmer (runs the exercises in Thonny)\na recorder (writes the team’s answers to the exercises)\na manager/presenter (keeps the team on track; interacts with class)\n\nLab: we’ll go through a series of programming assignments during our lab classes every Tuesday. These are posted as assignments in zyBooks, where you and you partner will also submit your solutions.\n\nIf feasible, you will work in pairs during the lab exercises and you may work in pairs for your homeworks as well. When you work in a pair, one of the partners should submit one copy of your work with both of your names and usernames on it. It’s wise for both partners to have copies of your shared solution. Your partner must be someone else from this course this semester.\nThe lab is configured to support the course work, but if you’re prepared to do some administrative work, you can configure your own machine to do the lab work. Alternatively, you can login remotely to the labs using a web browser. See “Getting Started” for more information.\n\nQuizzes: usually on Wednesdays, we will have a 15 to 20 minute closed-notes quiz on Moodle reviewing and applying the concepts we got from the unit. The quiz will be done in classroom, so you will want to bring your laptop or any other device.\n\nExceptionally at week 1, we won’t have a Quiz (too early for that).\n\n\nEvery other week, starting week 2, you will also have homework: these will also be posted as assignments on our zyBooks course page. These will total 3 homework assignments during the course.\n\nSchedule and deadlines\nOur schedule and the activities deadlines will be posted on our Class Schedule page and on the introduction pages of each module in this website. Where some tool we use is also supporting a calendar schedule, the deadlines will be there too (Moodle, zyBooks, Perusall).\nUnless stated otherwise, the assignment submissions are due by midnight of the due date. The Moodle calendar will list these due dates/times.\n\nLate work policy\nAnything submitted after the dealine is late, unless you have made prior arrangements with us. For each late assignment, you will be charged 10% for each business-day that you are late (e.g., if an assignment is due on Friday, you may turn it in on Monday at 10% off, Tuesday at 20% off and so on) and you need to email us to tell us which assignment you’re submitting late and how late it is. We will not accept work that is more than one week late unless you talk to us about the circumstances and negotiate a late-submission plan. We will generally grant up to 30% for these negotiated plans. We will also grant you 4 grace days with no penalty, no questions asked. Please note that grace days do not apply to the quizzes or the final project, and that we do not accept or negotiate for late work after the last day of class. If there are exceptional circumstances, please talk to us so we can work something out.\n\n\n\nGrading\nWe will compute your final grade as follows:\n\n5% — Preparation readings (zyBooks)\n5% — Perspectives readings (Perusall)\n10% — Lab exercises\n35% — Quizzes\n45% — Homeworks\n\nWe’ll throw out your lowest quiz score.\nYour grades will be available in the Moodle gradebook, generally before the next assignment of a similar type is due.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to succeed in this course?\n\n\n\n\nHelp others to succeed. The last thing we want to reinforce in our education is the idea that success only depends on individual effort. You’ll see that programming is much easier when done in community. Two or more people looking at the same code is twice or more the attention to details that is necessary for avoiding mistakes, remembering syntax and keeping objectives on track.\n\nThis doesn’t mean to be carried by our teammates - i.e., letting them do all the work for you. Insist in participating. Don’t split tasks and exercises. It may be easy to get good grades in courses that involve group work, but though it may solve your problem now (i.e., passing the course), this will be really a problem in the future, where you may be required to take the lead in solving a programming problem, for example. I’ve seen lots of cases like this in academic education and it is really awful.\n\nDon’t neglect textbook readings. In all my experience and a little of data analysis in courses I teach, there is a very clear correlation between low engagement with the textbook and low grades. So, be active in your reading. I know that everything around us today encourage us to just skim through texts, but that is not a good way to study. Think with the text. Ask questions. Annotate. Focus. You can do it.\n\nThe same applies for classes. Reading and listening aren’t passive. They are active abilities that can and have to be developed."

    "section": "Use of Technology",
    "text": "Use of Technology\nWe believe that technology is not neutral: we use them, but they also affect us. Consequently, technology in the classroom changes things. Studies suggest that internet-enabled electronic devices in the classroom reduces student performance. We will use technology in class, but with limits:\n\nYou may use a smartphone or laptop to complete retrieval quizzes and polls during designated times.\nYou may use laptops to take notes or attempt programming tasks.\nBeyond those uses, technology use in class should be limited to critical messages only.\n\nFurthermore, in general, it’s not a good idea to copy code from Web sources or to use large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Think of that as the same as cooking ready-made dinner in your microwave oven versus really learning how to cook. The results may sometimes be acceptable, but won’t be healthy and won’t put you in contact with ingredients and processes. As Christians, I believe we need to write the most humane and hospitable code we can, as a way of serving others and reflecting God’s glory. And for that, we need the disposition to fully engage with computational logic as a way of honoring God’s wisdom reflected in programming. Automating the process too much may alienate us - and our fellow people - from that, and cause a lot of problems.\nThis doesn’t mean I’m all against the use of generative AI. But we need to do that responsibly. There’s always a risk that these tools may fail and we may even not perceive it - not to mention the privacy issues. For more info on responsbile use of generative AI, see this page."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nCode re-use can be a valuable practice in computing, but reusing code or algorithms without attribution is plagiarism. If you’ve copied code with attribution, we’ll grade you on the code you wrote not on the code you copied. If we detect copying without attribution, i.e., plagiarism, we’ll be forced to give you a failing grade for the assignment and perhaps for the course. Additionally, we will report you to the office of Judicial Affairs, which may result in the incident being part of your student record.\nThe student-faculty relationship is based on trust and mutual respect, which can be seriously undermined by the suspicion or reality of academic dishonesty. Academic Dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism (students plagiarize when they do not credit the sources of their writing - the words, information, ideas, or opinions of others), improper group work, reuse of a paper from another course and/or cheating on a test. Students are encouraged to speak to their faculty member with specific questions related to academic dishonesty.

So as friends and community, we expect to treat each other with respect and courteous communication practices throughout the semester in all venues, including online forums. No personal attacks, trolling, or other kinds of bad language will be tolerated.\nWe are not just developing technical skill; we are also developing virtue and character through the acquisition of a technical skill. Please, take advantage of this opportunity.\nFurthermore, a wide range of things can interfere with your learning: trouble concentrating, stress/anxiety, relationship troubles, family situations, food or housing insecurity, substance use, and many more. You are encouraged to care well for yourself by keeping a consistent sleep schedule, eating well, avoiding drugs and alcohol, exercising, and taking time to relax and connect with friends and family.\nAlso, learning how to ask for help is an important part of the college experience. Many people on campus are eager to support you. The Center for Counseling and Wellness sees one out of five students each year and can connect you with a variety of mental health resources on and off campus. You can also reach out to me, another faculty/staff, a friend, or a family member you trust for help getting connected to support. You are not alone, and help is available!"
