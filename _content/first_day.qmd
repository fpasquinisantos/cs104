- Creation:
  - Computing is part of God’s world
    - it reveals wisdom and ingenuity on how God made things work (see Isaiah 28:23-29)
    - it is enabling science today (study of God’s world)
    - it is enabling new technology today (building culture for God's glory)
  - The process of breaking down a problem into precise steps can be a form of developing intellectual virtue
  - Through discovery and automation, it can enable human flourishing
  - There is joy in the process (creative, rewarding, fun)
- Fall:
  - It is being centralized into few powerful actors, harming cultural diversity and freedom
  - It is alienating people from God's good created order
  - It is being misused for Mammon
  - Constantly idolized
- Redemption:
  - We’re called to follow Jesus in showing God's glory through our cultural activity, which includes computing and its virtuous practice on:
    - imagining
    - designing
    - regulating
    - using

## Our relationship

Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 107:

When god forbids envy, hatred, and anger, he commands us to [h] love our neighbor as ourselves; to show [i] patience, peace, [j] meekness, [k] mercy, and all kindness, towards him, [l] and prevent his hurt as much as in us lies' and that we [m] do good, even to our enemies.
