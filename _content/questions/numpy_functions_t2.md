Given the following 3D NumPy array:

```python
import numpy as np
array = np.array([[[10, 20], [30, 40]], 
                  [[50, 60], [70, 80]], 
                  [[90, 100], [110, 120]]])
```

Calculate the mean of the maximum values from each 2D slice along the first axis. Describe your approach and provide the code you used to find this result.
