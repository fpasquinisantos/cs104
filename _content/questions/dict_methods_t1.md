Describe how you would use dictionary methods in Python to manage a collection of data about different animal species in a wildlife database. Specifically, outline how you would:

1. **Add** a new species to the dictionary, including its habitat and conservation status.
2. **Delete** an existing species from the dictionary.
3. **Modify** the habitat information for a species already present in the dictionary.

Provide examples of the Python code you would use for each operation, and discuss any considerations you need to keep in mind when performing these operations on a dictionary.
