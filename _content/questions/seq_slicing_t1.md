Slicing is a powerful feature in Python for manipulating sequences. Consider a `list data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`. How would you use slicing to achieve the following tasks?

1. Extract a sublist containing the elements from index 3 to 7 (inclusive) in reverse order.
2. Create a new list that includes every third element from the original list starting from index 2.
3. Obtain a sublist that consists of the first half of the original list.
