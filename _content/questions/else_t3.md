You are working on a Python script to categorize historical documents based on their publication year. The categories are defined as follows:

- "Ancient" if the publication year is before 500 AD
- "Medieval" if the publication year is between 500 and 1500 AD (inclusive)
- "Early Modern" if the publication year is between 1501 and 1800 AD (inclusive)
- "Modern" if the publication year is after 1800 AD

Write Python code that takes an integer `year` as input and returns the corresponding document category as a string. Provide the implementation of this function and explain how you use `if-elif-else` statements to categorize the publication year. Describe how each condition helps in determining the document category.
