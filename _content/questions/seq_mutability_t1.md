The goal of the following code is to create a new list `new_library` based on an original library (`games_library`). However, the code does not work as intended. What is the problem, and how can it be resolved?

```python
games_library = ['Super Mario', 'The Legend of Zelda', 'The Elder Scrolls']
new_library = games_library
new_library.append('Minecraft')
```
