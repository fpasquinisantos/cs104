Imagine you have a 1D NumPy array that contains hourly temperature readings from a weather station over a full week (7 days). The array has 168 values (24 readings per day). How would you use the reshape function to organize this data into a 2D array where each row represents a day, and each column represents an hour? Explain why this reshaping is useful for analyzing temperature patterns over the week.
