Which of the following operations can be performed on lists but not on tuples or strings?

A) Use the `+` operator to concatenate with another list  
B) Use the `*` operator to repeat the sequence  
C) Use the `.append()` method to add an element  
D) Use indexing to access elements

<!--
**Answer:** C) Use the `.append()` method to add an element

**Explanation:**

- **Concatenation with `+`** is valid for lists, tuples, and strings, allowing you to combine them.
- **Repetition with `*`** is valid for lists, tuples, and strings, allowing you to repeat the sequence.
- **The `.append()` method** is specific to lists and allows you to add an element to the end of a list. Tuples and strings are immutable, so you cannot modify them after creation.
- **Indexing** is valid for lists, tuples, and strings, allowing you to access individual elements.
