Imagine you are developing a system to track air quality measurements from various monitoring stations in a city. How could you use a dictionary in Python to manage this data, where each station records measurements for different pollutants over time? Design a dictionary structure to store the measurements for each station, including timestamps and pollutant levels, and describe how you would perform operations such as adding new measurements, updating measurements for a specific timestamp, and retrieving the average pollutant levels for a particular station over a given time period.
