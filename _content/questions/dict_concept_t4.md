Suppose you are developing a system to manage member information and donation records for a church. How could you use a dictionary in Python to organize this data, where each member has details such as contact information, membership status, and donation history? Design a dictionary structure to store each memberâ€™s information and describe how you would perform operations such as adding a new member, updating donation records for an existing member, and generating a report of total donations received from each member.
