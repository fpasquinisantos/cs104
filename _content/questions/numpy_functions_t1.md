Given the following 3D NumPy array:

```python
import numpy as np
array = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 
                  [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], 
                  [[13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]]])
```

Calculate the variance of the sum of each 2D slice along the first axis. Describe your approach and provide the code you used to find this result.
