Given the following NumPy arrays:

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([10, 20, 30])
b = np.array([2, 4, 6])
```

Which of the following operations performs element-wise multiplication of the arrays?

A) 
```python
result = a * b
```

B) 
```python
result = np.matmul(a, b)
```

C) 
```python
result = np.dot(a, b)
```

D) 
```python
result = np.outer(a, b)
```

<!-- Answer: A) -->
