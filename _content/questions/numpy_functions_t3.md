Given the following 3D NumPy array:

```python
import numpy as np
array = np.array([[[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12]], 
                  [[14, 16, 18], [20, 22, 24]], 
                  [[26, 28, 30], [32, 34, 36]]])
```

Calculate the sum of the variances of each 2D slice along the first axis. Describe your approach and provide the code you used to perform this calculation.
