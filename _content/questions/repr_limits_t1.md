Reflect on the concepts of "studiositas" (virtue) and "curiositas" (vice) in the context of ethical programming. How can these concepts guide a programmer's approach to developing software, particularly when dealing with sensitive data or potentially harmful technologies? Discuss how the balance between responsible curiosity and ethical restraint might influence decisions such as data representation, algorithm design, and the implementation of new technologies. Provide examples where unchecked curiosity could lead to ethical dilemmas, and how a virtuous approach might mitigate these risks.
