Suppose you are building a system to manage a library's book catalog. How could you use a dictionary in Python to keep track of book information, such as titles, authors, and availability? Design a dictionary structure for this use case and describe how you would perform operations such as adding a new book, updating the availability status of a book, and retrieving information about a specific book by its title.
