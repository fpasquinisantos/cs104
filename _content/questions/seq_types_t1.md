**Question:**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
data = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
data[2] = 99
```

Explain why this code will result in an error. How would you modify the code to achieve a similar effect with a list instead of a tuple? Provide the modified code and describe the differences between using a list and a tuple for this operation.

<!--
**Answer:**

The code will result in an error because `data` is defined as a tuple, and tuples are immutable in Python. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed or reassigned.

To achieve a similar effect using a list, you would modify the code as follows:

```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
data[2] = 99
print(data)
```

**Explanation of Differences:**

- **Lists** are mutable, so you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created. In this modified code, `data[2] = 99` changes the third element of the list from `3` to `99`, and `print(data)` will output `[1, 2, 99, 4, 5]`.
- **Tuples** are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation. Any attempt to change an element of a tuple will result in a `TypeError`.

The choice between using a list or a tuple depends on whether you need to modify the sequence. If you need a fixed, unchangeable sequence, use a tuple. If you need to modify the sequence, use a list.
