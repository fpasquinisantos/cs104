Suppose you have a 1D NumPy array that records the results of a scientific experiment conducted over multiple trials, where each trial consists of 50 consecutive measurements. How would you use the reshape function to reorganize this data into a 2D array so that each row corresponds to a separate trial? Discuss how reshaping the data in this way can make it easier to compare results across different trials.
