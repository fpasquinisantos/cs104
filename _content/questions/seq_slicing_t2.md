Slicing is a versatile feature in Python for working with sequences. Given a string `text = "Programming can be fun!"`, how would you use slicing to accomplish the following tasks?

1. Extract the substring from index 5 to 15 (exclusive) in reverse order.
2. Create a new string that includes every second character from the original string starting from index 4.
3. Obtain a substring that consists of the last quarter of the original string.
