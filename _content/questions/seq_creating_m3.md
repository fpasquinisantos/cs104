What will be the result of the following Python code?

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = (4, 5, 6)
c = a + (7, 8, 9)
```

**Options:**

A. `[1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]`  
B. `[1, 2, 3] + (7, 8, 9)`  
C. `TypeError`  
D. `(1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9)`

<!--
**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The code attempts to concatenate a list `a` with a tuple `(7, 8, 9)` using the `+` operator. Lists and tuples cannot be directly concatenated in this manner, which results in a `TypeError`. To avoid this error, you would need to convert the tuple to a list or the list to a tuple before concatenation.
