Slicing is an essential tool in Python for manipulating sequences. Given a tuple `items = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig', 'grape')`, how would you use slicing to perform the following tasks?

1. Extract a sub-tuple containing the elements from index 2 to 5 (inclusive) in reverse order.
2. Create a new tuple that includes every other element from the original tuple, starting from index 1.
3. Obtain a sub-tuple that contains the first third of the original tuple.
