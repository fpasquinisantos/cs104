Slicing is a useful feature in Python for manipulating sequences. Given a list `numbers = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]`, how would you use slicing to achieve the following?

1. Extract a sublist containing every element from index 2 to 8 (exclusive) in normal order.
2. Create a new list that includes every fourth element from the original list, starting from the beginning.
3. Obtain a sublist that consists of the last half of the original list.
