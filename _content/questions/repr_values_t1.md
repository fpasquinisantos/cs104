Consider the statement: "Every representation is a selective portrait of a reality according to a certain overlook and interest of who represents it." Reflecting on this, discuss how different data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) might impact the representation of complex concepts such as emotions or social relationships.

- How does the choice of an ordered vs. non-ordered data structure affect the representation and manipulation of data?
- In what ways might representing an emotion as a number, a boolean, or a dictionary impact our interpretation and use of that data?
- How can awareness of the limitations of data representations (e.g., imprecision, bias) influence our approach to programming?
