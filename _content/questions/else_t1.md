You are developing a Python application that needs to assign an age group to individuals based on their age. The age groups are defined as follows:

- "Infant" if the age is less than 2
- "Child" if the age is between 2 and 12 (inclusive)
- "Teenager" if the age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive)
- "Adult" if the age is between 20 and 64 (inclusive)
- "Senior" if the age is 65 or older

Write Python code that takes an integer `age` as input and returns the corresponding age group as a string. Provide the implementation of this function and explain how you use `if-elif-else` statements to determine the appropriate age group.
