You are creating a Python program to evaluate the level of a project based on its budget. The levels are categorized as follows:

- "Small" if the budget is less than $10,000
- "Medium" if the budget is between $10,000 and $50,000 (inclusive)
- "Large" if the budget is between $50,000 and $200,000 (inclusive)
- "Very Large" if the budget exceeds $200,000

Write Python code that takes a floating-point number `budget` as input and returns the corresponding project level as a string. Explain how you use `if-elif-else` statements to categorize the budget and describe how each condition is checked to determine the final project level.
