Which of the following statements correctly describes how lists, tuples, and strings handle indexing in Python?

A) Lists and tuples support indexing, but strings do not.  
B) Tuples and strings support indexing, but lists do not.  
C) Lists, tuples, and strings all support indexing, but they handle it differently.  
D) Lists and strings support indexing, but tuples do not.

<!--
**Answer:** C) Lists, tuples, and strings all support indexing, but they handle it differently.

**Explanation:**

- **Lists** support indexing and allow you to access and modify elements using indices.
- **Tuples** also support indexing but are immutable, so you can only access elements, not modify them.
- **Strings** support indexing and allow you to access individual characters, but they are immutable, so you cannot change them.

All three types handle indexing similarly in terms of accessing elements, but their mutability differs.
