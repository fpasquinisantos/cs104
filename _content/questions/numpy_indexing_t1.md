Write a Python code snippet to extract a sub-array from the following NumPy array:

```python
import numpy as np
array = np.array([[10, 20, 30, 40], [50, 60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]])
```

The sub-array should include the elements from the second and third rows, and the second and third columns.
