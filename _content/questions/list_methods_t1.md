Consider a list of student grades in a class. Describe how you would use list methods in Python to manage this list effectively. Specifically, outline how you would:

1. **Add** a new grade to the list.
2. **Remove** a specific grade from the list.
3. **Modify** a grade at a specific index in the list.

Provide examples of the Python code you would use for each operation, and discuss any considerations you need to keep in mind when using these methods. Additionally, explain how you would ensure that the list remains accurate and up-to-date as new grades are added or existing grades are modified.**
