Which of the following operations is not allowed in Python for the data types listed?

A) Modifying an element in a list  
B) Changing an element in a tuple  
C) Appending a character to a string  
D) Reassigning a value in a list  

<!--
**Answer:** B) Changing an element in a tuple

**Explanation:**

- **Lists** are mutable, so you can modify their elements and append new items.
- **Tuples** are immutable, so you cannot change their elements once created.
- **Strings** are immutable, meaning you cannot append to them; you would need to create a new string.
