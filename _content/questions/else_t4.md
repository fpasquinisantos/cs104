You are creating a Python function to categorize historical texts based on their word count. The categories are defined as follows:

- "Brief" if the word count is fewer than 1,000 words
- "Moderate" if the word count is between 1,000 and 5,000 words (inclusive)
- "Extensive" if the word count is between 5,001 and 20,000 words (inclusive)
- "Comprehensive" if the word count exceeds 20,000 words

Write Python code that takes an integer `word_count` as input and returns the category of the text as a string. Provide the implementation of this function and explain how you use `if-elif-else` statements to determine the text category.
