# Thonny IDE (POGIL, 15 min)

Thonny is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python designed for learning and teaching programming. It is freely available at [https://thonny.org/](https://thonny.org/).

**Do not run Thonny yet! Answer the questions first!**

Based on the screenshot:

1. Where is the *Shell* window?
   <!-- **Answer:** the second / bottom half -->
2. Where is the *Editor* window?
   <!-- **Answer:** the first / top half -->
3. What is the name of the file in the Editor?
   <!-- **Answer:** hello.py -->
4. What is the directory where this file is located?
   <!-- **Answer:** Desktop -->

---

Identify the number of lines corresponding to:

1. The program (in the Editor): \TextField[width=3cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** The source file contains six total lines; the 7th line is blank and doesn't count. -->
2. The output of the program: \TextField[width=3cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** The program displays three lines ("Welcome...", "What's...", and "Monty..."). -->

What is the symbol at the start of a line of program text not displayed as output?
\TextField[width=1.5cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** The pound sign: # -->

---

Consider the three program lines (in the Editor) that do not include text displayed as output. Describe what might be the purpose of:

1. A *comment* line (starts with a pound sign: `#`)

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** They are used to describe the purpose and/or behavior of the code. -->
2. A blank line
   <!-- **Answer:** They make the code easier to read. -->

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

---

Now open Thonny on your computer, type the code shown in the screenshot, save the file as hello.py, and run the program. Ask for help if you get stuck!

```python
#display a welcome message
print("Welcome to Python 3!")

#give the user a compliment
name = input("What's your name?")
print(name, "is a great name!")
```

---

What was required before the third line of the program output was displayed?

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** An answer needed to be entered (typed). -->

---

In the Shell window, what is the color of:

1. The program's output?
   <!-- **Answer:** black -->

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

2. The user's input?
   <!-- **Answer:** blue -->

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

---

Based on your experience so far, what is the difference between the text in the Editor window and the text in the Shell window?
   <!-- **Answer:** The editor contains a series of statements or commands which make up the program. The shell (or terminal) contains the program output text and an interface for program input. -->

\TextField[multiline=true,width=\linewidth, height=2.5em]{}

---

#### Describe what appears to be the purpose of each line of Python code in the Editor window:

1. Line 1:
   <!-- **Answer:** a comment to describe the purpose of the code -->
   
\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

2. Line 2:
   <!-- **Answer:** displays a message -->
      
\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

3. Line 3:
   <!-- **Answer:** a blank line to make the code easier to read -->

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

4. Line 4:
   <!-- **Answer:** a comment to describe the purpose of the code -->
   
\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

5. Line 5:
   <!-- **Answer:** gets input from the user -->
   
\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

6. Line 6:
   <!-- **Answer:** displays the final output -->

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

## Variables and Assignments (POGIL, 15 min)

In programming, an *assignment statement* saves a value to a *variable*. The variable "is set to" the value after the `=` *operator*. For example:

```python
mass = input("enter the mass in grams: ")
```

Selecting concise yet descriptive variable names is considered good programming style and will make your programs easier to read. Consider the examples in the table below.

**Do not type anything yet! Read the questions first!**

| Python code | Shell output |
|-------------|--------------|
| `data = 12` |              |
| `data`      | 12           |
| `Data`      | NameError    |
| `Data = 34` |              |
| `data`      | 12           |
| `Data`      | 34           |
| `my data = 56` | SyntaxError |
| `my_data = 78` |            |
| `3data = "hello"` | SyntaxError |
| `data3 = "world"` |        |
| `data3 = hello` | NameError |
| `mass = 273 + 100` |       |
| `273 + 100 = mass` | SyntaxError |
| `mass` | 373              |
| `Mass + 100` | NameError  |
| `mass - 100` | 273        |

Pick one assignment statement from the table above, and identify the following:

1. the variable being assigned: \TextField[width=3cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** data -->
2. the assignment operator: \TextField[width=3cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** = -->
3. the value of the variable immediately after the assignment: \TextField[width=3cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** 12 -->

Similar to the previous exercises, type each line of code in a Python Shell and write the corresponding output in the space above. If an error occurs, write what type of error. Place an asterisk (*) next to any output for which you were surprised.

Circle each *successful* assignment statement in the table above. How many are there?
\TextField[width=1.5cm]{}

What is the observed output of a successful assignment statement?
\TextField[width=1.5cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** There is no error message (there is no output at all). -->

After the successful execution of an assignment statement, how can you confirm the value of this variable?

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** You can type back the variable name to see its current value. -->

Based on the table's output, indicate whether each statement below is true or false:

1. Variable names in Python can start with a number. \TextField[width=1.5cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** false -->
1. Variable names in Python must start with a lower-case letter. \TextField[width=1.5cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** false -->
2. Variable names in Python may not include spaces. \TextField[width=1.5cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** true -->
3. Variable names in Python are case-sensitive. \TextField[width=1.5cm]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** true -->

Each of the following assignment statements has an error. Write a valid line of Python code that corrects the assignment statement. Double-check your code using a computer.

1. `3 + 4 = answer`
   
\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

   <!-- **Answer:** `answer = 3 + 4` -->
2. `oh well = 3 + 4`
   <!-- **Answer:** `oh_well = 3 + 4` -->

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}

3. `2x = 7`
   <!-- **Answer:** `x2 = 7` -->

\TextField[width=\linewidth]{}


Predict the value of the variable `mass` after executing all lines of code in the table. Then test your prediction on a computer, and explain the result.

\TextField[multiline=true, width=\linewidth, height=2.5em]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** The value is 373, because `mass` was only assigned one time. The other lines did not change the value of `mass`. -->

Write a line of Python code to assign the current value of `mass` to the variable `temp`. Show output that confirms that you have done this correctly, and explain the code.

\TextField[multiline=true, width=\linewidth, height=2.5em]{}
   <!-- **Answer:** The correct line is `temp = mass`. To verify the result, simply type `temp`. The assignment operation reads from right to left. -->
