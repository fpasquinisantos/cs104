## Programs are forms of wisdom

> 22 "The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old; 23 I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be. 24 When there were no watery depths, I was given birth, when there were no springs overflowing with water; 25 before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth, 26 before he made the world or its fields or any of the dust of the earth. 27 I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep, 28 when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep, 29 when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth. 30 Then I was constantly at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence, 31 rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind. Proverbs 8.22-31

# Computation {data-stack-name="computation"}

-   We use programs to **compute** numbers.

## Automatic computation

-   Charles Babbage is known for developing the first automatic computer machine (1820's)
    -   "the faster and more reliably one could calculate, the more money businesses could make."

-   Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, became enamoured by Babbage's machine and developed the first **algorithm**, to calculate a sum of numbers:

# Algorithm {data-stack-name="algorithm"}

-   Basically, a program: a description of a series of operations.
-   But with some specific features:
    1.  Precise and unambiguous steps
    2.  Definite results
    3.  Finite
    4.  Generalizable (works with a range of possible inputs)
    5.  Usually expressed through abstract/mathematical notation

## STEM today is programming computations

-   For complex calculations, we don't rely anymore on pressing calculator buttons. We have to make automatic computation programs

# Code {data-stack-name="code"}

-   Initially, computer operators had to set the program manually to run...

## Punched cards

-   At the end of the 1800s, Herman Hollerith invented the punched card, to be automatically read by a machine.
-   Instructions were then **CODED** in the punched card.

## Grace Hopper's proposal

-   Later, in 1949, Grace Hopper invented the first programming language: COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language)
    -   For example, the user would write:
        `COMPUTE SUM = (1 + 3)`
        `DIVIDE SUM BY 2 GIVING AVERAGE`
        
-   Crucial to this was the development of the **compiler**: a program capable of converting a sentence very much like an English phrase (with syntax and semantics) into machine instructions.

## So, what's a code?

-   "A program that follows a set of rules" (in order to be correctly interpreted)
-   To learn how to program, then, is to learn **how to express yourself correctly through the code**
    -   Notice the origin of the word - [codex](https://www.britannica.com/topic/codex-manuscript)

## Python programming language

-   Invented in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum, named after Monty Python's Flying Circus
-   Open source project
-   High-level, general-purpose language
-   Widely available, easy to learn, rich in tools and libraries, and portable
