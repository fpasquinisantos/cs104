> Lord, we come to you asking for your wisdom to navigate the complex technological world you put us and your church.\
We see the great powers that are laid today in the hands of big IT companies and institutions.\
Give us the grace and strength to resist these powers when they threaten our lives and the lives of our neighbors\
And, when we can't, be with us as we suffer the brokenness of the culture we live in.\
Just as our Lord Jesus suffered, give us the same hope that he had - that you have the power to make all things new.\
Let this hope shine forth, so that more people may come and glorify you.\
\
Lord, yours is the power, and you alone can do great things.\
We are sure we shall see your goodness in the land of the living (Psalm 27:13-14).\
Let us be strong, hold heart and wait for you, always. Amen.
